Here we include some corrections to \cite{pearls}.

\section*{Correction to 3.2.2}

The proof of Theorem 3.2.2 about decomposition of cubic graph with a bridge into 1-factors
does not explain why ``each bank has odd number of vertexes''.

This is true since the 1-factor containing the bridge brakes all the vertexes of each bank into pairs except the end vertex of the bridge.


\section*{Correction to 8.4.1}

There is an inaccuracy in the proof of Theorem 8.4.1 about stretchable planar graphs.
Namely in the planar drawing of $G-h$, the region $R$ might be unbounded.

To fix this inaccuracy, one needs to prove slightly stronger statement.
Namely that any planar drawing of the maximal planar graph $G$ can be stretched.
That is, given a planar drawing of $G$ there is a stretched drawing of $G$ 
and a bijection between the bounded (necessary triangular) regions such that corresponding triangles have the same edges of $G$ as the sides.

The remaining part of the proof works with no other changes.
