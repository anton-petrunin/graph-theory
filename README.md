## How to build

Building is very straightforward, you will need LaTeX and Git.
The following command will create a local copy of the source code for you.

`git clone https://github.com/anton-petrunin/graph-theory.git`

Go to the created folder and `pdflatex`:

`cd graph-theory/`<br/>
`pdflatex graph-theory.tex`
