I used these topics together with ``Pearls in graph theory'' by Nora Hartsfield and Gerhard Ringel \cite{pearls} to teach an undergraduate course in graph theory at the Pennsylvania State University.
I tried to keep clarity and simplicity on the same level.

Hope that someone will find it useful for something.

I want to thank 
Semyon Alesker,
Alexei Novikov,
and Lukeria Petrunina for help.
