Our next aim is to figure out how to find Kirchhoff minors $K_{G\backslash e}$ and $K_{G/e}$ of the graphs $G\backslash e$ and $G/e$ from $K=K_G$.



Note that from matrix $K_G$ one can reconstruct $A'$, and therefore the original matrix $A$ as well as the multigraph $G$.
Indeed, to get $A'$ we need to add one column and row to $K$ and fill it so that the sum in each column and row of the obtained matrix vanish;
this can be done in a unique way.

In particular, from the matrix $K$ we can find the number of the spanning trees $t(G)$.
Let us denote this number by $\delta(K)$, to emphasize that $\delta(K)=t(G)$ is a function of $K$.

Note that for the function $\delta(K)$ the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{delata-1} If we permute in $K$ a pair of columns and the pair of rows with the same numbers, then for the obtained matrix $K'$ we have 
\[\delta(K)=\delta(K').\]
Indeed, $K'$ describes the same graph $G$ with another enumeration of vertexes.

\item \label{delata-2}
If the sum of components in the first row in $K$ is positive, then
\[\delta(K)=\delta(K^{\circ})+\delta(K^{\bullet})\]
where the matrix $K^{\circ}$ obtained from $K$ by subtracting 1 from the corner component with indexes (1,1) and $K^{\bullet}$ denotes the $(n-2)\times(n-2)$-matrix, obtained from $K$ by deleting first column and first row.
This identity follows from the deletion-plus-contraction formula $({*})$ sinsce \[K^{\circ}=K_{G\backslash e}\quad\text{and}\quad K^{\bullet}=K_{G/e}.\]

\item\label{delata-3} If the sum of components in each row of $K$ vanish, then $\delta(K)\z=0$. 
Indeed, in this case the last vertex in our graph is isolated;
therefore the graph is not connected and has no spanning trees.

\item\label{delata-4} If $K$ is the unit matrix, then $\delta(K)=1$;
that is
\[
\delta\left(
\begin{matrix}
1&0&\cdots&0
\\
0&1&\ddots&\vdots
\\
\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&0
\\
0&\cdots&0&1
\end{matrix}
\right)=1.
\]
Indeed, in the corresponding graph $G$ all the vertexes labeled by $1,\dots,p-1$ connected to the vertex with label $p$ by unique edge. 
Therefore the graph $G$ is a tree and hence $t(G)=1$.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that all these properties are satisfied for the determinant of $K$, which we denote further by $\det K$.

Indeed, property \ref{delata-1} holds since permuting a pair of rows or columns in $K$ changes the sign of its determinant.
Hence making two permutations leaves the determinant unchanged.
Property \ref{delata-2} follows from the cofactor expansion of the determinant of $K$;
which is assumed to be known. 
If the sum of components in each row is zero, then the rows are linearly dependent;
hence property \ref{delata-3} follows.
The property \ref{delata-4} is evident.

Since these properties completely describe $\delta(K)$, we get the following theorem.



The method we used in the proof can be considered as a generalization of method of mathematical induction.
We proved equality of two numbers $t(G)$ and $\det K$ which defined in a very different way by showing that they both satisfy a list of common properties which completely defines the value $t(G)$.
