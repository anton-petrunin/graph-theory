\chapter*{Preface}

I used these topics together with the book ``Pearls in graph theory'' \cite{pearls} to teach an undergraduate course in graph theory at the Pennsylvania State University.
I tried to keep clarity and simplicity on the same level.

Hope that someone will find it useful for something.
